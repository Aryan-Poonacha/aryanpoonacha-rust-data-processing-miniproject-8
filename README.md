# Miniproject 8 For IDS 706

This repo recreates the functionality of [this](https://github.com/nogibjj/aryanpoonacha-sqlite-lab-miniproject-5) project using Rust instead of Python for increased performance.

# Documented Performance Improvement

The Makefile for this project and the python project both contain make deploy that perform all the required operations sequentially. We make use of the time CLI command to benchmark their performance to compare. The results of ```time make deploy``` for this Rust project is:

real    0m1.480s
user    0m0.278s
sys     0m0.227s

And the same command run on the python project on its corresponding codespace and environment is:

real    0m3.031s
user    0m0.159s
sys     0m0.044s

The real performance improvement is almost doubled for Rust.

## Rust Data Processing

This repository contains a collection of Rust scripts for data extraction, transformation, loading, and querying. The scripts interact with a SQLite database and a CSV file.

### Scripts

#### 1. `extract.rs`

This script downloads a CSV file from a specified URL and saves it to a local directory. It uses the `reqwest` crate for HTTP requests and the `tokio` crate for asynchronous programming.

To run this script, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin extract
```

#### 2. transform_load.rs
This script reads data from a CSV file and loads it into a SQLite database. It uses the csv crate to read CSV files and the rusqlite crate to interact with SQLite databases.

To run this script, use the following command:

```
cargo run --bin transform_load
```

#### 3. query.rs
This script queries the SQLite database and prints the cars with the most horsepower. It uses the rusqlite crate to interact with SQLite databases.

To run this script, use the following command:

```
cargo run --bin query
```

### Dependencies
This project uses several dependencies, including openssl, reqwest, tokio, csv, and rusqlite. Make sure to add these to your Cargo.toml file.

### Setup
Before running the scripts, make sure to install Rust and Cargo on your system. You can download them from the official Rust website.

Then, you can run the scripts as described above.
